# DEPRECATED

##Use the [vshn/puppet-gitlab](https://github.com/vshn/puppet-gitlab) module instead

## Why

This module was written back befefore omnibus when you had to compile from source. Revision 2.0 of the puppet module used the omnibus, but it downloaded packages from aws in a fragile way. With the advent of cloudpackages, it was time to rewrite again to use the repos. vshn beat me to it and wrote an excellent puppet module exactly how I would have refactored this one. Rather that duplicate his work, I'm passing the torch to him.
